# Javascript-miniproject-AnalogClock


I have created a analog clock using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. 
This clock is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices.
It not only displays the current time in a digital format but also includes the date, providing comprehensive information at a glance. 
The design is modern and intuitive, making it easy for users to read and interact with.
